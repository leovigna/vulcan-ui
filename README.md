# Chainlink Aggregator Dashboard
## Description
React app deployed at [feeds.link](https://feeds.link)
Opensource dashboard displaying custom Chainlink Aggregator data feeds.

## Environment Variables
### Fallback RPC
The vulcan dashboard uses a Mainnet and Ropsten fallback RPC for users who do not have a web3 plugin such as Metamask. Make sure to set the respective environment variables. You will need a websocket connection to listen to event updates.
```
REACT_APP_INFURA_MAINNET=<REPLACE_HERE>
REACT_APP_INFURA_MAINNET_WSS=<REPLACE_HERE>
REACT_APP_INFURA_ROPSTEN=<REPLACE_HERE>
REACT_APP_INFURA_ROPSTEN_WSS=<REPLACE_HERE>
```

### Default Contracts
The default Aggregator Contracts tracked by the app can either be defined under `./data/contracts.js` or leverage a GraphQL API. We recommend getting started with the hard-coded `contracts.js` file. Note that the app always offers the option to locally add custom contracts through the "Add Contract" tab.

If you wish to use the GraphQL API, be sure to get familiar with [vulcan-api](https://github.com/leovigna/vulcan-api) first. Then add the following environment variables.
```
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_HTTP_URI=<REPLACE_HERE>
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_API=true
```
